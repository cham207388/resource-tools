## 🏢 1. Homebrew (`brew`)

### 🔹 What is Homebrew?
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a **package manager for macOS** that allows you to install, update, and manage software easily. It simplifies installing **Python, Git, Node.js, PostgreSQL,** and many other tools.

### 🔹 How to Install Homebrew
To install Homebrew, open a terminal and run:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, verify:
```bash
brew --version
```

### 🔹 Basic Homebrew Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| **Update Homebrew** | `brew update` |
| **Upgrade installed packages** | `brew upgrade` |
| **List installed packages** | `brew list` |
| **Search for a package** | `brew search <package>` |
| **Install a package** | `brew install <package>` |
| **Uninstall a package** | `brew uninstall <package>` |
| **Clean up old files** | `brew cleanup` |

### 🔹 Install Essential Packages for Python Development
```bash
brew install pyenv pipx poetry
```

## 🐍 2. Python

### 🔹 What is Python?
Python is a **high-level programming language** used for **web development, scripting, data science, and automation**.

### 🔹 How to Install Python Properly

#### ✅ **Option 1: Use Pyenv (Recommended)**
[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) allows you to manage multiple Python versions.

Install **Pyenv**:
```bash
brew install pyenv
```

Then install a specific Python version:
```bash
pyenv install 3.12.2
pyenv global 3.12.2
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
python --version
```

#### ❌ **Option 2: Install Python via Homebrew (Not Recommended)**
```bash
brew install python
```
🚨 **Homebrew’s Python version is system-wide and may conflict with projects.**  
💯 **Using Pyenv is better** for flexibility.

### 🔹 Python Basics

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| **Check Python version** | `python --version` |
| **Run Python shell** | `python` |
| **Run a Python script** | `python my_script.py` |
| **Install a package (Not recommended, use pipx or poetry)** | `pip install <package>` |

---

## 🛋️ 3. Pipx

### 🔹 What is Pipx?
[Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is a tool that **installs Python applications in isolated environments**.  
Unlike `pip`, it **does not pollute** your global Python environment.

### 🔹 How to Install Pipx
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

Restart your terminal:
```bash
exec zsh  # or exec bash
```

### 🔹 How to Use Pipx

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| **Install a Python application** | `pipx install <package>` |
| **List installed applications** | `pipx list` |
| **Upgrade an installed app** | `pipx upgrade <package>` |
| **Uninstall an application** | `pipx uninstall <package>` |

### 🔹 Install Poetry Using Pipx
```bash
pipx install poetry
```

Verify installation:
```bash
poetry --version
```

---

## ✨ 4. Poetry

### 🔹 What is Poetry?
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a **dependency and package manager** for Python projects.  
It simplifies installing, managing, and publishing Python dependencies.

### 🔹 How to Use Poetry

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| **Create a new Poetry project** | `poetry new my_project` |
| **Navigate to your project** | `cd my_project` |
| **Initialize Poetry in an existing project** | `poetry init` |
| **Add a dependency** | `poetry add <package>` |
| **Remove a dependency** | `poetry remove <package>` |
| **Install all dependencies** | `poetry install` |
| **Run a Python script inside Poetry venv** | `poetry run python my_script.py` |

### 🔹 Ensure Poetry Uses Pyenv’s Python

1️⃣ Remove existing virtual environments:
```bash
poetry env remove $(poetry env info --path)
```
2️⃣ Create a new Poetry virtual environment using Pyenv:
```bash
poetry env use $(which python)
poetry install
```

Verify:
```bash
poetry env info
```

## 🚀 5. Best Practices & Workflow

| Task | Tool to Use |
|------|------------|
| **Installing software & dependencies** | `brew` |
| **Managing Python versions** | `pyenv` |
| **Installing global Python apps (e.g., Poetry, Black, Flask CLI)** | `pipx` |
| **Managing project dependencies** | `poetry` |

### 🔹 Recommended Python Development Workflow
```bash
# Install Pyenv, Pipx, and Poetry
brew install pyenv pipx
pipx install poetry

# Install a specific Python version
pyenv install 3.12.2
pyenv global 3.12.2

# Create a new Python project
mkdir my_project && cd my_project
poetry init

# Set Python version for the project
poetry env use $(which python)

# Install dependencies
poetry add requests pandas

# Run Python inside the virtual environment
poetry run python my_script.py
```
